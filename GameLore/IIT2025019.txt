--------------Start----------------
You wake up in a drop-pod crash site, your HUD flickers to life.
It reads "Attempt number 489. Distance to Target: 10km".
You are a Courier, your mission is to carry a volatile Thermal Cell to the city reactor.
You step out into the harsh winter biome and see a soldier in your exact uniform.
It is a frozen skeleton but it attacks you, animated by a leaking battery pack.
You fight off the undead clone and check the dog tags, they read "Courier 488".
In their pocket a note reads "If the next one finds this... don't look at my face".
You move forward into the forest where the snow has melted into a radioactive swamp.
The heat from hundreds of dead couriers has mutated the nature here.
Mechanical crows circle above, screeching to alert the pack.
Wolves with exposed wires in their fur rush you, knowing that Courier means food.
You find a radio log that says "The drones... they are betting on us dying".
You survive the forest and reach the asphalt city, it is completely silent.
The streets are blocked by Ice Golems, ancient riot bots protecting the ruins.
They scan you as an intruder and try to freeze you to preserve the city.
You fight your way to the central tower, expecting to find survivors.
But the reactor room is a graveyard, the floor is littered with used Thermal Cells.
You realize the city has been dead for decades and you are just fuel.
You plug your cell in anyway and the machine hums for a second.
"Energy insufficient, please insert more couriers" the AI voice booms.
You collapse from exhaustion as the screen fades to black.
The camera pans up and flies all the way back to the military base.
A fresh drop pod opens and a new clone steps out.
The HUD reads "Attempt number 490".
